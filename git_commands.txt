#GITHUB
#remote adds a link for git to conect to the internet

git remote add origin https://github.com/Niladri-B/git_repository.git
#Note: Must MANUALLY create repository on GITHUB by clicking + on top right hand corner
## git_repository is then the name you give to the new repo and type as repo.git
git remote -v #lists our URLS i.e origins
git push origin master #push changes to github

git clone <partner URL>
git pull origin master

#In case of conflict
#git pull will mention conflict and error
#open with nano and the different lines will be highlighted
#follow up with git status

#If you try to merge a particular git repo with a pre-existing remote repo from a different folder, you may be prompted at Vim
#Proceed as follows
##	Press 'i' to enter 'Insert' mode
##	Now you are in 'non-modal' form and can type as in a normal text editor. Type in reasons for merge.
##	Once done press 'esc' to enter back into 'modal' form i.e command mode
##	Type ':w' and press 'enter' to save changes
##	Type ':q' and press 'enter' to quit

#Can change default text editor from vim to something else
git config --global core.editor nano

#More useful commands
git clone <URL> # use this to copy data from online repo
git fetch alias # fetch differences from online to update local and remote repo  # here alias would be origin because origin is the alias for remote repo
